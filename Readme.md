### **README: Peer-to-Peer Tutoring System**

---

### **Introduction**

The Peer-to-Peer Tutoring System is a decentralized application designed to streamline interactions between tutors and students using blockchain technology. This system leverages the Aptos blockchain to create, manage, and complete tutoring sessions in a secure and transparent manner. It ensures that tutors receive payment directly from students without the need for intermediaries, offering an efficient and trustless way to connect individuals for educational purposes.

The core features include session creation by tutors and secure payment processing for students, all backed by the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain.

### **Vision**

Our vision is to revolutionize the traditional education system by enabling direct and fair transactions between tutors and students. By utilizing blockchain technology, we aim to:
- Provide a platform where knowledge sharing is borderless, secure, and fair.
- Empower tutors with tools to manage their sessions while ensuring timely payments.
- Offer students access to quality learning resources without concerns about intermediaries or transaction inefficiencies.

We strive to make quality education accessible and affordable for everyone worldwide.

### **Future Goals**

As the Peer-to-Peer Tutoring System evolves, we aim to introduce several enhancements to improve user experience and functionality:

1. **Escrow Mechanism**:
   - Implement a secure escrow system to hold session payments until both parties confirm the completion of the session.

2. **Dispute Resolution**:
   - Add a decentralized mechanism to handle disputes between students and tutors effectively.

3. **Multi-Session Support**:
   - Enable tutors to manage multiple active sessions simultaneously, enhancing scalability.

4. **Reputation System**:
   - Introduce a rating and review system to build trust and accountability among users.

5. **Tokenized Incentives**:
   - Reward users (both tutors and students) with tokens for active participation and high ratings.

6. **Cross-Platform Accessibility**:
   - Develop user-friendly web and mobile interfaces to make the platform easily accessible globally.

### **How to Get Started**

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Install the [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/install-cli) to interact with the blockchain.

2. **Clone the Project Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd PeerToPeerTutoring
   ```

3. **Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract**:
   Ensure the `Move.toml` file contains your desired account address, then run:
   ```bash
   move build
   move publish --profile dev
   ```

4. **Interact with the Contract**:
   Use the CLI or a compatible frontend to call the following functions:
   - `create_session`: Tutors can create a new tutoring session by specifying a fee.
   - `complete_session`: Students can pay the tutor and mark the session as completed.
